# Why AI Uncharted?

The name captures exactly what this journey feels like — we're all navigating uncharted territory when it comes to artificial intelligence. Every week brings new tools, new capabilities, and new possibilities that didn't exist just months before.

## The Uncharted Territory

Traditional education and career paths haven't caught up to the AI revolution. There's no established curriculum for "AI orchestration" or "prompt engineering mastery." We're all pioneers, figuring it out as we go.

This site documents my expedition into this territory.

## Learning in Public

Rather than waiting until I'm an "expert" to share knowledge, I'm documenting the journey in real-time. This serves multiple purposes:

**Accountability** — Publishing my experiments creates pressure to actually complete projects and think them through properly.

**Knowledge Retention** — Writing about what I learn helps cement the knowledge and creates a searchable reference for my future self.

**Community Building** — Others on similar journeys can learn from my successes and failures, and hopefully share their own insights.

## The Hands-On Philosophy

AI is moving too fast for purely theoretical learning. The only way to truly understand these tools is to use them, push their limits, and build real things that solve real problems.

Every post here represents actual experimentation:
- Real tools configured and tested
- Real problems identified and solved
- Real workflows built and optimized
- Real failures analyzed and learned from

## Building the Future

We're not just learning about AI — we're actively shaping how it gets integrated into our workflows, our businesses, and our lives. Every experiment contributes to the collective understanding of what's possible.

This site is my contribution to that collective knowledge.
