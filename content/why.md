Welcome to AI Uncharted – a quiet space for learning in public, building without certainty, and pushing beyond what feels comfortable.

This project isn’t the result of a grand plan. It grew out of a growing need to explore artificial intelligence in a hands-on, honest way – not from the outside, but from within.

I don’t come from software development. My background is in accounting and business operations, with years of experience structuring systems, analyzing problems, and setting up cloud environments and Kubernetes clusters. I’ve always worked close to complexity – and learned best when I didn’t fully understand what I was doing at the start.

### Why this space exists:

**To learn and grow**
This is where I untangle things – from AI agents and local LLMs to infrastructure, automation, and orchestration. Not to impress, but to understand.

**To document and reflect**
Writing things down – the why, the how, the failures – helps me think. And if it helps someone else too, even better.

**To build things that matter**
I’m testing agents, workflows, and tools designed to solve real problems. Not because I know what I’m doing, but because I’m willing to figure it out.

### On AI itself
AI isn’t just for developers, and it’s more than a tool for generating text or images. Used intentionally, it can support business logic, augment decision-making, and automate work that once felt immovable.

But that takes more than prompts – it takes process, context, and architecture.

That’s what I’m exploring here.

### ⚙️ What to expect
This site is part lab, part logbook. Some experiments will fail. Some will click into place. Most will live somewhere in between – as stepping stones to something more useful.

If you’re here for polish, you might be disappointed.
If you’re here for process, welcome.
