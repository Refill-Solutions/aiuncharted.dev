# About Me

I'm a developer and AI enthusiast on a mission to master artificial intelligence through hands-on experimentation. Rather than getting lost in theoretical frameworks, I believe the best way to understand AI is to build with it, break it, and learn from the process.

## My Approach

**Learning by Building** — Every post here represents real experiments with real tools, real problems, and real solutions.

**Documentation as Learning** — Writing about what I build helps solidify understanding and creates a knowledge base for future projects.

**Open Exploration** — I share both successes and failures, because the journey matters as much as the destination.

## Current Focus

Right now, I'm deep into:
- Local AI development environments
- Workflow automation with AI agents
- Building practical tools that solve real problems
- Exploring the intersection of AI and productivity

## Tech Philosophy

I believe the future belongs to those who can effectively orchestrate AI tools rather than build them from scratch. My focus is on becoming an expert AI operator, integrator, and innovator.
