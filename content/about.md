Hi! I'm Erik Nergaard, and this is my journey into the world of AI.

I have a background in auditing and accounting, which gives me a unique perspective on business operations, compliance, and finance. My motivation for starting this project is to learn, experiment, push my comfort zone, and build profitable businesses with AI.

Through this blog, I will share my experiences, challenges, and successes as I explore how AI can transform business processes and create new opportunities.
