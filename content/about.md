This isn't a showcase. It's a workshop.

Behind this blog is someone who prefers to stay out of the spotlight, but who still chooses to build in public – not because it's comfortable, but because discomfort is where growth happens. Sharing the process, rather than just the results, is a way to make learning visible and remind others that progress doesn't require perfection.

The background isn't in software development. It's in business systems, accounting, and both solution and enterprise architecture – designing how systems connect, how organizations work, and how processes should flow. While I've worked on development projects alongside frontend and backend teams, I've never been a developer in the traditional sense. The closest is probably setting up Kubernetes – essentially, a way to tell computers how to run and manage lots of programs reliably, without doing it manually each time.

The focus here is not AI as a trend, but AI as a tool – something anyone can explore and use, not just developers. Where possible, I use tools with a low barrier to entry – like self-hosted platforms, open-source frameworks, or drag-and-drop automation – that others can realistically adopt without being experts themselves.

This blog documents what I test, what I break, and what I build. The content can get technical and occasionally messy – because that's the reality of learning something real. I don't claim expertise. But I do believe that with enough curiosity and time, anyone can understand how these tools work.
