This isn’t a showcase. It’s a workshop.

Behind the blog is someone who prefers to stay out of the spotlight, but still chooses to build in public – because learning, slow mastery, and deep exploration often require stepping outside what feels safe.

The background is rooted in finance and business systems, but the path has led much further – into AI, automation, cloud infrastructure, Kubernetes, and the creation of practical digital tools. Not as a developer, but as an architect, analyst, and endlessly curious problem-solver.

The focus here is artificial intelligence – not as a trend, but as a tool. Not just for developers, but for anyone willing to go beyond writing emails, generating images, or stitching together short videos.

The content will at times be technical and complex. That’s simply where curiosity tends to thrive – in the unknown, where the learning curve is steep, and the pieces only fit after some resistance.
