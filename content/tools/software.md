# Software Stack

This page documents the software tools and frameworks that power my AI development workflow.

## Development Environment

**AI Development Tools**
- Cursor (with Claude integration for coding)
- VS Code (backup editor)
- Git & GitHub (version control)
- [GitHub Apps](https://docs.github.com/en/apps) - Secure repository integration for automation
- Hugo (static site generation)

**Local AI Models**
- [To be documented as I set up local LLM infrastructure]
- Model serving: [TBD - likely Ollama or similar]
- Vector database: [Evaluating Pinecone vs local options]

## AI Frameworks & Libraries

**Python Ecosystem**
- [To be documented based on current projects]
- LangChain/LlamaIndex considerations
- Hugging Face integrations
- Custom tooling and scripts

**Web Development**
- Next.js (for AI-powered web applications)
- React (frontend components)
- Node.js (backend services)
- [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) - Modern Python web framework for APIs
- TypeScript (type safety)

## Infrastructure & DevOps

**Container Orchestration**
- [k3s](https://k3s.io/) - Lightweight Kubernetes distribution for local development
- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) - Production container orchestration

**GitOps & Deployment**

- Message queuing for service communication

**Remote Access & Networking**
- [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) - Zero-config VPN for secure remote access
- Secure networking between development environments

## Orchestration & Automation

**Workflow Tools**
- n8n (workflow automation)
- [Additional automation tools TBD]
- Custom scripts and integrations

**Model Management**
- [Local model serving solution TBD]
- Model version control and deployment
- Performance monitoring tools

## Development Workflow

**Code Generation & Assistance**
- Cursor + Claude Sonnet (primary coding assistant)
- OpenAI Codex (code completion)
- GitHub Copilot (backup code assistance)

**Project Management**
- [Documentation tooling TBD]
- Issue tracking and project planning
- Automated testing and deployment

## Configuration Examples

*As I implement and configure these tools, I'll add actual configuration files and setup instructions here.*

## Performance & Optimization

*Performance metrics, optimization techniques, and lessons learned will be documented as I build out the stack.*

*This page will evolve as I build and document my actual software setup.*
