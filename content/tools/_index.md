# Tools & Technical Stack

This section documents my complete AI development environment ‚Äî from hardware specifications to cloud integrations. It's both a reference for my own work and a resource for others building similar setups.

## Stack Overview

**üñ•Ô∏è [Hardware](/tools/hardware/)** ‚Äî Local development machine, server specifications, and storage solutions.

**üíª [Software](/tools/software/)** ‚Äî Local LLMs, development environments, orchestration tools, and AI frameworks.

**‚ö° [Workflows](/tools/workflows/)** ‚Äî Automation pipelines, agent configurations, and process optimizations using tools like n8n and custom scripts.

**üîó [Integrations](/tools/integrations/)** ‚Äî External services and APIs I integrate with, from ElevenLabs for voice to Pinecone for vector storage.

## Philosophy

I believe in documenting everything for two reasons:

1. **Personal Reference** ‚Äî Complex setups are easy to forget. This serves as my own technical documentation.

2. **Community Knowledge** ‚Äî Others building similar systems can learn from my configurations, mistakes, and optimizations.

Each section includes actual configurations, real performance metrics, and honest assessments of what works (and what doesn't).
