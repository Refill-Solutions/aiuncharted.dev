# Workflows & Automation

This page documents the automated workflows and processes that keep my AI development environment running smoothly.

## Content Creation Workflows

**Blog Publishing Pipeline**
- Hugo static site generation
- Git-based version control
- Cloudflare Pages deployment
- Automatic builds on push

**Mermaid Diagram Generation**
- Current: Manual Mermaid.js integration
- Future: AI-powered flowchart generator (in development)

## Development Workflows

**AI-Assisted Coding**
- Cursor + Claude Sonnet for architecture and complex reasoning
- Real-time code generation and debugging
- Automated testing and deployment pipelines

**Project Management**
- GitHub Issues and Projects (project tracking)
- Automated todo list generation from conversations
- Progress tracking and milestone management

## AI Model Workflows

**Local Model Management**
- [To be documented as local infrastructure develops]
- Model deployment and versioning
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- Automated model updates and testing

## n8n Automation Workflows

**Planned Automations**
- Content publication notifications
- Social media cross-posting
- Performance metric collection
- Automated backup processes

*Actual n8n workflows will be documented as they're implemented.*

## Media Processing

**Image & Video Workflows**
- ffmpeg for video processing and optimization
- Image optimization for web delivery
- Automated thumbnail generation
- Asset organization and storage

## Monitoring & Analytics

**Performance Tracking**
- Site performance monitoring
- AI model performance metrics
- Resource usage tracking
- Error monitoring and alerting

## Integration Workflows

**Cross-Platform Automation**
- GitHub → Cloudflare Pages (deployment)
- Local development → Cloud services
- AI tools → Content generation
- Analytics → Performance optimization

## Workflow Diagrams

*As workflows are implemented, I'll add Mermaid diagrams showing the actual process flows.*

## Optimization Notes

*Performance improvements, bottleneck identification, and process refinements will be documented here.*

*This page will be updated as I build and optimize these automated workflows.*
