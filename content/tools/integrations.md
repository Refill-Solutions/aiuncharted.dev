## Integration Architecture

*As integrations are implemented, I'll add diagrams showing how all these services connect.*

## API Keys & Security

*Security best practices for managing API keys and service credentials are documented internally.*

## Cost Analysis

*Regular cost analysis and optimization notes for all paid services.*

## Evaluation Queue

**Currently Evaluating:**
- Local vs cloud vector database solutions
- Analytics platform options
- Content distribution automation
- Performance monitoring tools

*This page will be updated as I implement and test these integrations.*
