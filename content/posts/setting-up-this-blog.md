## The Journey

### 1. Domain Selection üåê
I wanted something that captured the essence of exploring AI's uncharted territories. After researching various options, **aiuncharted.dev** felt perfect - it's professional, memorable, and clearly indicates the focus on AI development and exploration.

### 2. Framework Choice ‚ö°
Hugo was chosen for its:
- **Speed**: Blazing fast static site generation
- **Simplicity**: Markdown-based content creation
- **Flexibility**: Easy theming and customization
- **Performance**: Perfect Lighthouse scores out of the box

### 3. Deployment Strategy ‚òÅÔ∏è
Cloudflare Pages provides:
- **Free hosting** with excellent performance
- **Automatic builds** on git push
- **Global CDN** for fast loading worldwide
- **Custom domain** support with SSL

### 4. Current Challenges & Future Plans

The biggest challenge was template compatibility issues with complex themes. That's why I switched from LoveIt back to the reliable Ananke theme.

**Next up**: Building an AI-powered flowchart generator! üéØ
