# AI Uncharted

Welcome to AI Uncharted â€“ a personal sandbox and notebook for exploring, testing, and gradually mastering artificial intelligence through hands-on experimentation rather than pure theory.

This project serves as a public workshop where the journey into AI, automation, cloud infrastructure, and practical digital tools is documented. It's built by someone with a background in finance and business systems, approaching AI not just as a developer, but as an architect, analyst, and endlessly curious problem-solver.

The focus is on artificial intelligence as a practical tool, going beyond common applications to explore its deeper potential. The content will often be technical and complex, reflecting the nature of deep learning and problem-solving in the AI space.

This blog aims to share insights, challenges, and successes from a continuous learning journey, inviting others to join in the exploration of the uncharted territories of AI.
